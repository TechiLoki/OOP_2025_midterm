# OOP_2025_midterm
 
## 1. Challenges faced

Writing this midterm was a rather interesting experience. The main issues I faced were JavaDocs and creating .md files, since I haven't really worked on this before. The tasks themselves were rather easy to understand since there were no new technologies involved in this exam, only what we have already covered.

## 2. AI tools

I did use AI tools (ChatGPT specifically). It was rather useful because using AI like this makes understanding various concepts way easier. I did not have to think of a way to phrase what I wanted to search on the internet, I could just explain my issue to the AI and it'd understand and explain to me in simple terms if needed. 

Additionally, it's really great for checking your syntax. For example, I was not sure if you could access an element of list in array-style (as in list[i]), so I quickly asked ChatGPT about that and I did not have to google various code samples to see that specific line. AI just directly explained to me how it works and what I can do.

As I mentioned, I primarily used AI to help me with the syntax of .md files, as well as some questions regarding syntax.

## 3. Cases where you have tried AI, but without desired result

There were no such cases, since I exactly knew what I needed from the AI and that's what I requested from it, resulting in clear and comprehensive communication back and forth.
